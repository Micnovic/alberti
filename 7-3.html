    <h2>Delicacy in the Adorning the Temples</h2>

    <p>
        Being guided by Plato's Opinion, thought it necessary that the People should be admonished by the Laws to lay aside all Manner of Delicacy in the Adorning their Temples, and take Care only to have them perfectly clean and white. However, says he, let the Structure of them be beautiful. I confess, for my own Part, I am very ready to believe, that Purity and Simplicity of Colour, as of Life, must be most pleasing to the Divine Being; and that it is not proper to have anything in a Church that may be likely to draw off Men's Thoughts from Devotion and fix them upon the Pleasure and Delight of the Senses.

    </p>
    <p>
        But still I am of Opinion, that he is highly to be commended, who, as in other publick Structures, so also in Temples, without departing from the Gravity requisite in such Works, endeavours to have all the Parts, the Walls, Roof, and Pavement, as handsome and elegant as possible, still chiefly having it in his Eye to make all his Ornaments the most durable that may be.
