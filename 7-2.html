    <h2>The Round Figures</h2>

    <p>
        It is manifest that Nature delights principally in round Figures, since we find that most Things which are generated, made or directed by Nature, are round. Why need I instance in the Stars, Trees, Animals, the Nests of Birds, or the like Parts of the Creation, which she has chosen to make generally round? We find too that Nature is sometimes delighted with Figures of six Sides; for Bees, Hornets, and all other Kinds of Wasps have learnt no other Figure for building their Cells in their Hives, but the Hexagon.
