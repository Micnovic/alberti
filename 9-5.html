        There are some other natural Proportions for the Use of Structures, which are not borrowed from Numbers, but from the Roots and Powers of Squares. The Roots are the Sides of square Numbers: The Powers are the Areas of those Squares: The Multiplication of the Areas produce the Cubes. The first of all Cubes, whose Root is one, is consecrated to the Deity, because, as it is derived from One, So it is One every Way; to which we may add, that it is the most stable and constant of all Figures, and the very Basis of all the rest. But if, as some affirm, the Unite be no Number, but only the Source of all others, we may then suppose the first Number to be the Number two. Taking this Number two for the Root, the Areas will be four, which being raised up to a Height equal to its Root, will produce a Cube of eight; and from this Cube we may gather the Rules for our Proportions; for here in the first Place, we may consider the Side of the Cube, which is called the Cube Root, whose Area will in Numbers be four, and the compleat or entire Cube be as eight.
