    <h2>The Temples</h2>
    <div id="chapter">
    <p>
        In the whole Compass of the Art of Building, there is nothing in which we ought to employ more Thought, Care and Diligence than in the laying out and adorning a Temple; because, not to mention that a Temple well built and handsomely adorned is the greatest and noblest Ornament a City can have; it is moreover the Habitation of the Gods: And if we adorn and beautify the House where a King or any great Man is to dwell, with all the Art we are Masters of, what ought we to do to those of the immortal Gods? Whom we expect, when invoked, to be present at our Sacrifices, and to give Ear to our Prayers. And though the Gods may despise those perishable Things which we most highly value; yet Men are moved by the Purity of beautiful Materials, and raised by them to Reverence and Devotion for the Deity to which they are sacred.

    </p>
    <p>
        It is certain that Temples may be of great Use for stirring up Men to Piety, by filling their Minds with Delight, and Entertaining them with Admiration of their Beauty. The Ancients were wont to say, that Piety was honoured when the Temples were frequented. 		For this Reason I would have the Temple made so beautiful, that the Imagination should not be able to form an Idea of any Place more so; and I would have every Part so contrived and adorned, as to fill the Beholders with Awe and Amazement, at the Consideration of so many noble and excellent Things, and almost force them to cry out with Astonishment: This Place is certainly worthy of God!

    </p>
    <p>
        I would have the Temple as large as the Bigness of the City requires, but not unmeasurably huge. What I should chiefly desire in a Temple, would be this, that every Thing which you behold should be such; that you should be at a Stand which most to commend, the Genius and Skill of the Workmen, or the Zeal and Generosity of the Citizens in procuring and dedicating such rare and beautiful Materials to this Service; and be doubtful whether those very Materials conduce most to Beauty and Stateliness, or to Duration, which, as in all other Buildings both publick and private, so chiefly in the Structure of Temples, ought to be very carefully consulted; in as much as it is in the highest Degree reasonable that such a great Expence should be well secured from being lost by means of any Accidents, besides that Antiquity gives no less Awfulness, than Ornaments do Beauty, to any Structure of this Nature.

    </p>
    <p>
        Lastly, the Place where you intend to fix a Temple, ought to be noted, famous, and indeed stately, clear from all Contagion of secular Things, and, in order thereunto, it should have a spacious handsome Area in its Front, and be surrounded on every Side with great Streets, or rather with noble Squares, that you may have a beautiful View of it on every Side.
