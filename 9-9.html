    <h2>The Rules which give the Ornaments themselves their main Excellence</h2>
    <div id="chapter">
    <p>
        Now the Rules which give the Ornaments themselves their main Excellence, are as follows. First all your Ornaments must be exactly regular, and perfectly distinct, and without Confusion: Your Embellishments must not be too much crowded together or scattered as it were under Foot, or thrown on in Heaps, but so aptly and neatly distributed, that whoever should go about to alter their Situation, should be sensible that he destroyed the whole Beauty and Delicacy of the Work. There is no Part whatsoever but what the Artist ought to adorn; but there is no Occasion that all should be adorned equally, or that every thing should be enriched with equal Expence; for indeed I would not have the Merit of the Work consist so much in Plenty as in Variety. Let the Builder fix his richest Ornaments in the principal Places; those of a middling Sort, in Places of less Note, and the meanest in the meanest. And here he should be particularly careful, not to mix what is rich with any thing trifling, nothing little with what is great, nor to set any thing too large or high in narrow or close Places; tho' things which are not equal to each other in Dignity, nor alike even in Species, may very well be placed together, so it be done artfully and ingeniously, and in such a Manner, that as the one appears solemn and majestick, the other may shew chearful and pleasant, and that they may not only unite their different Beauties for the Embellishment of the Structure, but also seem as if the one without the other had been imperfect; nor may it be amiss in some certain Places to intermix somewhat even of a coarse Sort, that what is noble may receive a yet further Addition from the Comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let such Ornaments as are proper to the Middle be placed in the Middle, and let those which are at equal Distances on each Side, be proportioned exactly alike. In short, let every thing be measured, and put together with the greatest Exactness of Lines and Angles, that the Beholder's Eye may have a clear and distinct View along the Cornices, between the Columns on the Inside and without, receiving every Moment fresh Delight from the Variety he meets with, insomuch, that after the most careful and even repeated Views, he shall not be able to depart without once more turning back to take another Look, nor, upon the most critical Examination, be able in any Part of the whole Structure to find one Thing unequal, incongruous, out of Proportion, or not conducive to the general Beauty of the Whole.
