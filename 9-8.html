    <h2>Errors: want of ornament</h2>

    <p>
        It is another great Error to have raised your Structure in such a Manner, that, though indeed with Relation to its Platform, it is not amiss, yet, not withstanding it may be in very great Want of Ornament, it may be utterly incapable of any Sort of Embellishment as if all you consulted in raising your Wall, was to sustain the Roof, not leaving any Space where you can afterwards conveniently or distinctly add either the Dignity of Columns, the Embellishment of Statues, the Majesty of Picture, or the Delicacy of any Incrustation. An Error of much the same Nature as this is, the Building with so little Consideration, that though the same Expence might make our Structure beautiful and graceful, yet we neglect the Pains and Contrivance of effecting it: For it is undeniable that there may be in the mere Form or Figure of a Building, an innate Excellence and Beauty, which strikes and delights the Mind, and is immediately perceived where it is, as much as it is missed where it is not; for, indeed, the Eye is naturally a Judge and Lover of Beauty and Gracefulness, and is very critical and hard to please in it; neither can I give any Account why it should always happen, that we should be much more offended at what is wanting, than ready to commend what is done well; for still we are continually thinking what further might be added to make the Object still more splendid, and are naturally displeased if anything is omitted, which the most accurate, ingenious, and diligent Artist might possibly have procured: So that indeed we are often at a Loss to say what it is offends us, unless it be that there is not wherewithal fully to satisfy our immoderate Desire of Perfection. This being the true State of the Case, we should certainly endeavour, as much as in us lies, by the greatest Study and Care, to make whatever Structure we raise as handsome, and as compleatly adorned as possibly, especially if it be such a one as every body expects to see in the utmost Perfection, as, for Instance, a publick Structure, and particularly a sacred one, which no Man can bear to see naked of Ornament. It is another Error to apply the Ornaments peculiar to a publick Structure, to a private one; or, on the other Hand, those peculiar to private Edifices to one of a publick Nature: Especially if such Ornaments are any thing petty, or not durable, as, for Instance, to dish up a publick Structure with slight or paultry Painting; for every Thing used about a publick Edifice ought, if possible, to be eternal. It is another gross Error, which we see some ridiculous People run into, whoever they have well begun their Building, fall to painting it, and decking it with Statues and other Embellishments without Number; all which are sure to be spoiled and demolished before the Building is finished.
