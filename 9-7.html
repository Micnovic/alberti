        Among the Errors in Ornament, the Principal, in Architecture as in Nature, is making any Thing preposterous, maimed, excessive, or any other Ways unsightly: For if these Things are reckoned defective and monstrous in Nature herself, what must we say of an Architect that throws the Parts of his Structures into such improper Forms?
