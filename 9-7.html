    <h3>Errors: Confusion, Absurdity and Venture</h3>
    <div id="chapter">
        <p>
            Among the Errors in Ornament, the Principal, in Architecture as in Nature, is making any Thing preposterous, maimed, excessive, or any other Ways unsightly: For if these Things are reckoned defective and monstrous in Nature herself, what must we say of an Architect that throws the Parts of his Structures into such improper Forms? And as the Parts whereof those Forms consist, are Lines, Angles, Extension, and the like, it is certainly true, that there can be no Error or Deformity more absurd and shocking, than the mixing together either Angles or Lines, or Superficies which are not in Number, Size and Situation equal to each other, and which are not blended together with the greatest Care and Accuracy. And indeed who can avoid blaming a Man extremely, that without being forced to it by any Manner of Necessity, draws his Wall crooked and askew, winding this way and that like a Worm crawling upon the Ground, without any Rule or Method, with one Side long, and another short, without any Equality of Angles, or the least Connection with Regard to each other; making his Platform with an obtuse Angle on one Side, and an acute one on the other, and doing everything with Confusion, Absurdity and at a Venture
