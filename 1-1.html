    <h2>Of Designs; their Value and Rules</h2>
    <div id="chapter">
    <p>
        Being to treat of the designs of edifices, we shall collect and transcribe into this our work, all the most curious and usesul observations left us by the Ancients, and which they gathered in the actual execution of these works; and to these we shall join whatever we ourselves may have discovered by our study, application and labour, that seems likely to be of use.
    </p>
    <p>
        But as we desire, in the handling this difficult, knotty, and commonly obscure subject, to be as clear and intelligible as possible; we shall, according to our custom, explain what the nature of our subject is; which will shew the origin of the important matters that we are to write of, at their very fountainhead, and enable us to express the things that follow, in a more easy and perspicuous style.
    </p>
    <p>
        We shall therefore first lay down, that the whole art of building consists in the Design, and in the Structure. The whole Force and Rule of the Design, consists in a right and exact adapting and joining together the Lines and Angles which compose and form the Face of the Building. It is the Property and Business of the Design to appoint to the Edifice and all its Parts their proper Places, determinate Number, just Proportion and beautiful Order; so that the whole Form of the Structure be proportionable. Nor has this Design any thing that makes it in its Nature inseparable from Matter; for we see that the same Design is in a Multitude of Buildings, which have all the same Form, and are exactly alike as to the Situation of their Parts and the Disposition of their Lines and Angles; and we can in our Thought and Imagination contrive perfect Forms of Buildings entirely separate from Matter, by settling and regulating in a certain Order, the Disposition and Conjunction of the Lines and Angles. Which being granted, we shall call the Design a firm and graceful preordering of the Lines and Angles, conceived in the Mind, and contrived by an ingenious Artist.

    </p>
    <p>
        But if we would enquire what a Building is in its own Nature, together with the Structure thereof, it may not be amiss, to consider from what Beginnings the Habitations of Men, which we call Edifices, took their Rise, and the Progress of their Improvement: Which unless I am mistaken, may be resolved as follows.
