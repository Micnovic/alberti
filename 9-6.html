We are now to say something of the Rules of those Proportions, which are not derived from Harmony or the natural Proportions of Bodies, but are borrowed elsewhere for determining the three Relations of an Apartment; and in order to this we are to observe, that there are very useful Considerations in Practice to be drawn from the Musicians, Geometers, and even the Arithmeticians, of each of which we are now to speak. These the Philosophers call Mediocrates, or Means, and the Rules for them are many and various;

        But there are three particularly which are the most esteemed; of all which the Purpose is, that the two Extreams being given, the middle Mean or Number may correspond with them in a certain detemined Manner, or to use such an Expression, with a regular Affinity. Our Business, in this Enquiry, is to consider three Terms, whereof the two most remote are one the greatest, and the other the least; the third or mean Number must answer to these other two in a just Relation or proportionate Interval, which Interval is the equal relative Distance which this Number stands from the other two. Of the three Methods most approved by the Philosophers for finding this Mean, that which is called the arithmetical is the most easy, and is as follows. Taking the two extreme Numbers, as for Instance, eight for the greatest, and four for the least, you add them together, which produce twelve, which twelve being divided in two equal Parts, gives us six. THIS Number six the Arithmeticians say, is the Mean, which standing between four and eight, is at an equal Distance from each of them. THE next Mean is that which is called the Geometrical, and is taken thus. Let the smallest Number, for Example, four, be multiplied by the greatest, which we shall suppose to be nine; the Multiplication will produce 36: The Root of which Sum as it is called, or the Number of its Side being multiplied by itself must also produce 36. The Root therefore will be six, which multiplied by itself is 36, and this Number six, is the Mean. THIS geometrical Mean is very difficult to find by Numbers, but it is very clear by Lines;

        The third Mean, which is called the Musical, is somewhat more difficult to work than the Arithmetical; but, however, may be very well performed by Numbers. In this the Proportion between the least Term and the greatest, must be the same as the Distance between the least and the Mean, and between the Mean and the greatest, as in the following Example. Of the two given Numbers, let the least be thirty, and the greatest sixty, which is just the Double of the other. I take such Numbers as cannot be less to be double, and these are one, for the least, and two, for the greatest, which added together make three. I then divide the whole Interval which was between the greatest Number, which was sixty, and the least, which was thirty, into three Parts, each of which Parts therefore will be ten, and one of these three Parts I add to the least Number, which will make it forty; and this will be the musical Mean desired. AND this mean Number forty will be distant from the greatest Number just double the Interval which the Number of the Mean is distant from the least Number; and the Condition was, that the greatest Number should bear that Portion to the least.
