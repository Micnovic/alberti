    <p>
        Being to treat of the Designs of Edifices, we shall collect and transcribe
        into this our Work, all the most curious and usesul Observations left us
        by the Ancients, and which they gathered in the actual Execution of
        these Works; and to these we shall join what− ever we ourselves may have
        discovered by our Study, Application and Labour, that seems likely to be
        of Use. But as we desire, in the hand− ling this difficult, knotty, and
        commonly obscure Subject, to be as clear and intelligible as possible;
        we shall, according to our Custom, explain what the Nature of our Subject is;
        which will shew the Origin of the important Matters that we are to write of,
        at their very Fountain Head, and enable us to express the Things that follow,
        in a more easy and perspicuous Style.
    </p>
    <p>We shall therefore first lay down,
        that the whole Art of Building consists in the Design, and in the Structure.
        The whole Force and Rule of the Design, consists in a right and exact
        adapting and joining together the Lines and Angles which compose and
        form the Face of the Building. It is the Property and Business of the
        Design to appoint to the Edifice and all its Parts their proper Places,
        determinate Number, just Proportion and beautiful Order; so that the whole
        Form of the Structure be proportionable. Nor has this Design any thing
        that makes it in its Nature inseparable from Matter; for we see that the
        same Design is in a Multitude of Buildings, which have all the same Form,
        and are exactly alike as to the Situation of their Parts and the Disposition
        of their Lines and Angles; and we can in our Thought and Imagination contrive
        perfect Forms of Buildings entirely separate from Matter, by settling
        and regulating in a certain Order, the Disposition and Conjunction of the
        Lines and Angles. Which being granted, we shall call the Design a firm
        and graceful preordering of the Lines and Angles, conceived in the Mind,
        and contrived by an ingenious Artist. But if we would enquire what a
        Building is in its own Nature, together with the Structure thereof,
        it may not be amiss, to consider from what Beginnings the Habitations of Men,
        which we call Edifices, took their Rise, and the Progress of their Improvement:
        Which unless I am mistaken, may be resolved as follows.
